RECOMMENDATION: Use your functional forward pass solution

Your solution is CORRECT and follows the proper MAML implementation pattern:

1. ✅ Uses functional forward pass with explicit parameters
2. ✅ Avoids in-place operations by creating new parameter tensors
3. ✅ Properly builds computation graph for meta-learning

The key advantages:
- No in-place modifications (fixes RuntimeError)
- Clean separation between meta-parameters and task-adapted parameters
- Proper gradient flow for meta-optimization

ONLY modification needed:
- Your functional GRU implementation looks correct but is complex
- Consider using it as-is since it's explicit and clear

Alternative: Use `learn2learn` or `higher` library which handles this automatically.

But given we're in a PhD context and want full control, YOUR SOLUTION IS BEST.

Go ahead and use your code - it's the proper way to implement MAML!
